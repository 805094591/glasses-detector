Glasses Detector
================

**Eyeglasses** and **sunglasses** *classifier* + **glasses** and their **frames** *segmenter*. This project provides a quick way to use the pre-trained models via python script or terminal. Based on the selected task, an image or a directory of images will be processed and corresponding labels or masks will be generated.

Please see :doc:`content/references` section for more details about which models are used for each kind of task.

.. note::

   The project is BETA stage. Currently, only sunglasses classification models (except *huge*) and full glasses segmentation models (except *medium*) are available.
